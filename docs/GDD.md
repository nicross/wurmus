Endless tag meets snake

## Gameplay
- You are the head of a snake that can walk and run in any direction
- Each part of you is an individual person linked in arms
- Start with one extra person
- Additional folks are spawned on a timer that decreases in duration as time goes on
- They run toward your tail and avoid your head
- If they collide with your head, they join the snake as the next link
- If they collide anywhere else, or you run into yourself, everyone at that point and back runs away in random directions
- Game is over when you lose all folks

## Sound design
- Each person emits the same footstep sound
- Each person's footsteps have a different frequency
- Attached folks have filtered footsteps
- When facing folks they emit a solid tone
- When facing attached folks they emit a fast beep
- Frequencies follow the C-major scale
